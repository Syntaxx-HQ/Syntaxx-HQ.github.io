                Its development arc resembles Star Wars Episode III &mdash;
                it seems promising, but you know it won't end well.
                Yet here we are, parsing HTML documents, applying CSS styling,
                computing layout, and rendering pixels. Against all odds.

            <h2>Frequently Questioned Decisions</h2>
            <p class="section-subtitle">The questions we ask ourselves at 3am</p>
            <div class="faq-list">
                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>What is Hokuto?</summary>
                    <p>
                        Hokuto is what happens when you think "how hard can rendering HTML be?" and then
                        spend weeks finding out. It's a vibecoded rendering engine written in Rust that
                        somehow manages to display (some) web content. We're as surprised as you are.
                    </p>
                </details>

                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>Why is it called "Hokuto"?</summary>
                    <p>
                        The author has a thing for naming projects after Japanese train lines. Hokuto is
                        a limited express train running between Sapporo and Hakodate. Does it have anything
                        to do with HTML rendering? Absolutely not. Does it sound cool? Yes. That's the
                        entire decision-making process. Previous projects include equally random train names.
                        It's a lifestyle.
                    </p>
                </details>

                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>Why not just use a real browser?</summary>
                    <p>
                        Great question. We ask ourselves this daily. The official answer is "performance"
                        and "control." The real answer is we were too deep into the project before we
                        realized what we'd gotten ourselves into. Sunk cost fallacy is real.
                    </p>
                </details>

                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>What CSS features are supported?</summary>
                    <p>
                        120+ properties! Flexbox, Grid, transforms, gradients, animations... basically
                        everything except the things you'll definitely need. Check the test suite and
                        pray your use case is covered.
                    </p>

                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>Does it support JavaScript?</summary>
                    <p>
                        No, and that's a feature, not a bug. You want interactivity? Use Rust. You want
                        type safety? Rust. You want to mass 10 hours debugging why your click handler
                        doesn't work? Go use Electron.
                    </p>
                </details>

                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>Why does it look like Star Wars Episode III?</summary>
                    <p>
                        Because just like Anakin, this project started with hope and good intentions.
                        "I'll just implement a simple HTML renderer," we said. "It'll be quick," we said.
                        Now we're debugging float layouts at 2am questioning our life choices.
                    </p>
                </details>

                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>Is it production-ready?</summary>
                    <p>
                        Define "production." Define "ready." If your production environment is forgiving
                        and your CSS is simple, sure! If you need pixel-perfect rendering of complex
                        layouts... maybe test thoroughly first. And have a backup plan.
                    </p>
                </details>

                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>Why no table support?</summary>
                    <p>
                        Have you ever read the CSS table layout spec? It's 47 pages of pain. The code
                        looked at the spec and said "no." We respect its decision. Use Grid instead.
                        It's 2024. Tables are for data, not layout.
                    </p>
                </details>

                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>How accurate is the rendering?</summary>
                    <p>
                        We have 214 tests that pass! That means for 214 specific HTML files, we match
                        Chrome. For everything else? It's an adventure. Every bug is a surprise feature.
                        Every fix creates two new edge cases.
                    </p>
                </details>

                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>Will this end well?</summary>
                    <p>
                        Probably not. But that's never stopped anyone before. The codebase grows,
                        the edge cases multiply, and somewhere in the distance, we hear the Imperial
                        March playing. But hey, at least the gradients look pretty.
                    </p>
                </details>

                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>Where is the source code?</summary>
                    <p>
                        Yeah... about that. The source code is not publicly available. We're deeply
                        ashamed of what's in there. Trust me bro, you don't want to see it. Some things
                        are better left in the shadows. Just enjoy the pretty pixels and don't ask
                        questions about the eldritch horrors that generate them.
